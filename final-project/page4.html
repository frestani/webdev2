                This project was one of the more interesting ones I’ve done for my classes. I chose to interview individuals of differing faiths and religions. With these three interviews,I’ve learned a great deal about spirituality and faith, what it means to others, how it affects their outlooks on life, and so much more. What I found most significant throughout this interview process is how faith can look different, and that you can still be spiritual without prescribing to one set religion or faith. I also learned a great deal about how I can start my journey into rediscovering faith again. At first, I wasn’t too keen on the idea of choosing religion as my topic, but I thought it could bring me insight and allow me to experience the world in a different way. Since interviewing Radwa Khan, Nancy Gartner, and Stacy Restani, my perspective on religion and faith has shifted into more of a positive light. As a child who grew up in the Catholic school system, I had lost my faith early on and was a devout agnostic. I still respected religion, but didn’t care to apply it to my life. As I grew older, I wanted to learn more about faith, and this project was the perfect opportunity to do so. Since the interviews, I have been attending a non-denominational church and picked up a few books that focus on Christianity. Stacy, my mom, actually bought me Cold-Case Christianity by J. Warner Wallace as my first foray into literature that deals with religion. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to interview all three of these individuals.

                There were other factual things I learned throughout the interview process. Christianity, Islam, and Mormonism all believe in one God, and thus are monotheistic religions. All three religions also believe in the existence of Jesus Christ, but with different perspectives on who he was. With Christianity, it is believed that Jesus is the true Son of God and is part of the Holy Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Mormons, or the Church of Latter-Day Saints, also believe that Jesus was the Son of God. With Islam, however, they do not believe he was the son of God, but rather, a prophet. The teachings between all three religions are very similar, as the Bible and the Qu’ran are holy books that share a lot of information and history pertaining to their religions, God, and Jesus. There are different ways of praying as well. Muslims pray five times a day on a prayer mat facing the sun. Mormons and Christians pray the “conventional” way - with their hands clasped, or even just by closing their eyes and “speaking” with God that way.

                All in all, I really enjoyed working on this project. It brought me closer to the people I interviewed and broadened my horizons in terms of faith. I learned about religion, spirituality, hope, love, and the promise of everlasting life and happiness. The gifts that come from believing in God seem plentiful and abound, and I hope to share some of those gifts with myself and others.
