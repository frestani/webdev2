              Faith and religion has been a topic that has surrounded my life since I was a child. I
attended a Catholic school from kindergarten through eighth grade, but lost my faith around fifth
grade. I have identified as agnostic since then, but I still have a curiosity when it comes to faith,
and I’ve been exploring the idea of having spiritual guidance and incorporating aspects of faith
into my life. For this interview, I wanted to seek more information on faith and religion as a
whole, and what it brings to a person’s life.

            <p>
              To get a more intimate look and perspective on this topic, I chose to speak with my
mother, Stacy Restani. She is a 54-year-old woman who works as an instructional aid at an
elementary school. She has been a part of my journey and started it for me, as she was the one
who enrolled me into a private Catholic school. She has had several religious perspectives - she
attended Methodist, Presbyterian, and Catholic church services throughout her life. She now
identifies as a Christian, but has her own beliefs and personal relationship with faith.

              While my mom has been a part of religion for her whole life, it wasn’t until she was older
that it became a significant part of her life. I asked her what had changed - <span class="quotes">“As I got older, in my
  early twenties, I did a lot of soul searching and reading books.”</span> These, along with her journey,
are what carried her through this life for the past 30+ years. I wanted to know what faith had
brought into her life, as she has always mentioned that accepting God comes with gifts. <span class="quotes">“It gave
  me unexplainable joy and peace, life-changing experiences. God constantly keeps me on the
  right path.”</span> It seems that having faith brings a bounty of blessings that people may not be able
to find themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
              My mom mentioned to me that she didn’t consider herself a part of any true organized
religion, but I never asked her to elaborate until this interview. <span class="quotes">“Many of my beliefs are personal
  between myself, God, and Jesus. I strive to have a personal relationship with Jesus.”</span> She
believes in God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, but doesn’t agree with all of the religious texts that
focus on Christianity. One thing she strongly believes in is that Jesus died for our sins so that we
may get into Heaven. <span class="quotes">“If you’re a true Christian, you have to accept Jesus into your heart as
  your Savior in order to get into heaven. The true life we will live as believers of Christ will take
  place in Heaven - that is our reward.”</span> 
            </p>

            <p>
              Something that I always wondered about was how faith had changed my mom as a
person. She had gone through many events in her life that affected her greatly, and some of the
negative ones she experienced as a child shaped her into a colder human being. With her
reignited faith, she changed into a loving, caring, and empathetic person. <span class="quotes">“My relationship with
  Jesus has brought me indescribable serenity and patience. I got a lot of patience as I delved
  more into my relationship with him. I’m a lot more joyful - the Holy Spirit has brought me joy that
  is unexplainable. I’m grateful.”</span>
            </p>

            <p>
              This interview facilitated my understanding of faith and religion, and helped me to gain a
deeper understanding of my mom as a person. A common theme among different religions is
what one receives from believing in something and how it positively shapes one’s life. Faith and
religion do not only change one’s beliefs and mindsets, but it shapes you into a different person
blessed with gifts like peace, compassion, and the promise of a life greater than this one we
experience on this Earth. Faith is important, and I believe everyone could use some aspects of it
in their own lives - after all, this interview showed that there is more to gain than there is to lose.
