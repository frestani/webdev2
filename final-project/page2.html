                    The purpose of my research for this class project was to further my understanding of
faith and religion, and how I could apply aspects of what I learn to apply to my own journey in
faith and discovering my beliefs. The first person I interviewed to discuss the topic of faith was
Radwa Khan. She is a phlebotomist and has been one of my closest friends since the early
days of grade school, where we met. I felt she was a qualified candidate for this research
project as she is a Muslim who has extensive knowledge about her faith and religion, and she is
an introspective person who has had many life experiences that shaped her beliefs and values.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Radwa is a Muslim, or a follower of Islam. Islam’s fundamental beliefs come from their
Holy Book, the Quran, and the teachings of the prophet Muhammad. Radwa was born into her
faith, with her parents providing her with education of Islam and its teachings. She, however,
hasn’t always followed the religion - at the age of 16, she was raped and this traumatic event
shifted her worldview completely, and came to believe in no God.<span class="quotes">“I became an atheist out of the
    thought process of why horrible things happen to good people. How could God allow that? Why
    didn’t God protect me?”</span> Her father was also a negative impact on her faith - a verbally and
emotionally abusive parent, Radwa knew her father as the man who preached religion but
chose not to practice it. He didn’t provide a healthy, nurturing environment that should have
been bountiful with the fruits of God, and it contributed to her becoming an atheist. <span class="quotes">“I didn’t want
    to believe in anything my dad believed in because I began to think if I believed in what he
    believed in, I would become him.”</span> As time passed, she began searching for faith again, and
chose Islam. She has since then followed the teachings and beliefs of the religion, practicing it
in her daily life and using it to form a unique perspective on the world and life itself.

                <p>
                    Radwa’s faith in God and belief in Islam are significant in her understanding of the world.
<span class="quotes">“It brought a kind of discipline that even inpatient and outpatient programs couldn’t in certain
    areas of my individuality. For starters, strengthening my relationship with God ultimately gave
    me a sense of fear and love for a higher power.”</span> Radwa then continues to speak about her
experiences with outpatient and rehab programs, and mentions how having fear in a higher
power helped her with abstinence, and explains that this abstinence can be applied to anything
in life. I asked her how else her religion helped her with sobriety - <span class="quotes">“My discipline and faith in God
    is what kept me in check, helped me maintain my sobriety thus far, and the result of meditation
    humbled my character and calmed my personality.”</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    It seemed to me that most religions shared the same basic principles - love thy neighbor,
display respect to others, help those in need, etc. - but I wanted to know more about how the
principles of religion affected Radwa. What were her most sacred ideals? She spoke about how
today’s society undervalues intimacy and promotes hookup culture. <span class="quotes">“Through my faith and
    through personal experience, you realize at a point of maturity that you are exchanging
    precious, sacred energies. Because of this, I strictly believe in a form of commitment as my faith
    has taught me. There’s a beauty in being selective. And I believe that is a beautiful mentality for
    anyone and everyone to have.”</span> In Islam, it is forbidden to drink alcohol, so I decided to ask her
about that too. She maintained that sobriety is the purest form of existence, and today’s society
glamorizes partying and drinking as positive experiences. There are also a number of other
factors that alcohol can lead to, such as addiction, criminal activity, <span class="quotes">“and the abusive, impulsive,
    reckless behaviors that transpire from being under the influence."</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the things I wanted to discover was how faith can change a person, from their
beliefs to their personalities and ways of thinking. Radwan was someone I wanted to personally
ask about this question because she is a kind, thoughtful, introspective, reflective, and
self-aware person. She offers great guidance and is the most forgiving person I know. When I
relayed this question to her, she responded with <span class="quotes">“It has educated me, brought me awareness,
    broadened my mind in ways sitting in a classroom couldn’t/learning from my elders couldn’t.
    Due to faith, I can confidently say I have reached the most raw and purest state of peace all
    around.”</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    During this interview, I learned a significant amount of information about her religion and
its impact on her life, but I also learned more about how she functions and how her beliefs
propel her in life. The guidance that she gets from her God is the guidance that she gives to me,
and it appears that who she is as a person is because of her faith in God and the teachings that
her religion brings her. My understanding of faith has increased and I can see how applying
certain values can improve my life and bring me direction and hope.
