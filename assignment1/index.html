      <p>The World Wide Web was always intended for everyone - free to use, free to learn, and free to develop. It is thanks to Tim Berners Lee that we are able to enjoy the Internet and its plethora of websites developed by a variety of different people. Today, the Internet and World Wide Web are at our fingertips and allow us to do virtually everything that we need to do online. The landscape for web development has improved greatly while still holding true to being free and accessible to all.</p>
      
      <p>Web developers, or authors, are one of the most important assets in this day and age. They are able to bridge the gap between people and information at an instantaneous rate, allowing people to check their emails, view weather forecasts, shop, read, and more. Not only are they responsible for ensuring mobile and desktop users can access their pages, they must ensure that what they share is concise, readable, and accurate. There is an infinitesimal amount of information available at our fingertips and it’s imperative to be able to know what information we’re handling. To take in new information, web authors work to make sure that the content is condensed to essential information. It must also be clearly presented to the user, where navigation and user interface make sense. Being free of pop-up ads, having sectioned information, and organizing data are all facets of making content readable for website visitors. Another major portion of the responsibility of a web author is to present accurate information - keeping the material up-to-date and portraying things properly are part of what makes the Internet such a successful tool.</p>

      <p>In today’s society, web authors are the glue that binds people and ideas together. With social media sites like Facebook or search engines like Google, it is possible to communicate with virtually anyone and learn virtually anything. The role of web authors in society is to grant people with connectivity. Facebook, for example, is a website that hosts millions of users worldwide to connect via posts and messages. The developers of Facebook are responsible for the task of keeping the lines of communication open for individuals. We, as humans, are innately social creatures; that hasn’t changed. Now, thanks to web developers, we have the ability to connect instantaneously with other people who are using the same websites. News, life updates, and community events all get posted to these social media sites, too. If web authors were unable to promote the growth of online activity, these groups would have a difficult time congregating or communicating. Some social groups and individual connections would fade, and we would be limited to slower, less effective means of communication. Our society survives and thrives because of web authors, leading us to live varied lives.</p>

      <p>On the business side of the spectrum, the role of web authors is to represent data accurately and efficiently. Many businesses rely on websites and ad promotions to garner customers or clients. It is with utter importance that these websites have information about the company and its services and ways to contact them, as well as have a reliable way to do business and have certain services available online. Web authors build the pathway between customer and business. Similar to how certain societal groups would be impacted negatively without web authors, businesses would no longer be able to flourish online or have a readily accessible way to gain information about a particular service or company. Web developers are responsible for keeping a website interface to allow the conduction of business to be possible.</p>

      <p>Web authors are capable of producing great and relevant work. We are capable of accessing the world and what it has to offer with the technology that we have today. What’s missing from the field of web development, however, is confidence in freedom. There has been a continuous fight for an open Internet and World Wide Web so that anyone can publish a website or view content without having limitations by big companies like Google or Facebook. We should continue striving for a free, accessible Internet for all - our lives are online, and we have the right to keep it for all web authors and individuals, not just technological giants. The future state of the Internet should remain the way Tim Berners Lee intended it: available for everyone.</p>
