      <h2>A Short Look into Deaf Education in American History</h2>
      <p>Deaf education pre-1880 was a positive time for sign language. Fingerspelling was recognized as the first language of traditional sign language in 1878, and students were being taught using sign language. It was the most beneficial method of teaching at the time. Post-1880, however, there was a shift in the idea of how deaf education should be executed - in 1880, the International Congress on the Education of the Deaf in Milan, Italy, decreed that oralism was the only method that should be utilized in Deaf schools. This brought upon a dark age for Deaf people, making education a struggle and leaving some students left in the dust with no real language and thus, no real education. In current years, some aspects of oralism are utilized, but the primary communication method used in Deaf education is sign language. It is accepted as a full language, and is being taught in non-Deaf schools as a foreign language. This radical change bettered Deaf education and provided more accessibility to students, ensuring Deaf people get the education they need and deserve.</p>

    <h2>How to Improve the Quality of the Deaf Community</h2>
    <p>To this day, there are still struggles within society for acceptance and accessibility of Deaf people and culture. There are numerous ways that we can continue educating and engaging todayâ€™s population to improve the caliber of our communities. We can start by creating more opportunities for hearing people to learn sign language and communicate with Deaf individuals, perhaps with conventions, school programs, or clubs, thereby also creating safe spaces. We can also amplify Deaf voices on social media to spread more awareness, stop misinformation, and provide educational information. The biggest step to higher-quality communities is creating legislation and promoting policies that support the communities, and there is a vast array of things that we could change to better our communities.</p>
